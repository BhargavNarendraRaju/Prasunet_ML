The House Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model to estimate house prices based on specific features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle's "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition to train and evaluate a linear regression model. The key steps include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and generating predictions for a test dataset.
